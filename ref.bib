  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a small, low cost force sensor based on a 
  commercially available photointerrupter for use in a tendon-driven robotic hand.
  The proposed sensor consists of a photointerrupter and an elastic frame and is designed
    to measure tendon tension. Using the design methodology presented in this paper, 
    the force sensor can be made small enough (4mm x 6mm x 10mm) to be inserted into a 
    robotic fingertip and made able to measure a large allowable force (approximately 200N)
    with low non-linearity (1.85%) and low hysteresis (1.19%). 
    Due to the characteristics of the photointerrupter, it is possible to overcome
      the disadvantages associated with traditional miniature force sensors and to have
      very high resolution (0.1N) over the entire measurement range (0–200N).
        To verify feasibility, we performed force feed-back control using a prototype 
        of the sensor. Experimental results show that the proposed sensor has comparable
        performance to commercial force sensors of similar size and can be manufactured
          more simply and economically.}

  The parameters that are considered in this model are voltage, current, the power of HPLED, the number of the LEDs in the module, 
  thermal parameters such as the junction temperature of LED, heat sink and fin temperature, ambient temperature, and thermal resistances. 
  The proposed model will be helpful for designing and predicting the luminous output of LED and also arriving at optimal heat sink and fin configurations for a given design.",

  ABSTRACT = {This paper starts with an overview of the main principles used for pressure measurements, focusing on their usage in industrial applications domains. Then, the importance of calibration procedures, namely, static and dynamic calibration of pressure sensors, is analyzed. Regarding calibration, it is important to note that there are several applications where the pressure signals to be measured can have large variations in short periods of time. In industrial applications, particularly in continuous production processes, generally, dynamic pressure measurements are less common; however, they are still required in several cases, such as control loops that are very sensitive to pressure variations, even if the frequencies of those variations are in the range of a few tens of hertz, or even lower. The last part of the paper presents the hardware and software of a flexible and low-cost static and dynamic pressure calibrator that also presents the capability to generate arbitrary waveform pressure signals for calibration and testing purposes. The proposed calibrator also includes the following advantages: remote pressure sensing capabilities that can be used to minimize calibration errors, such as those associated with capillary effects and pressure leakages; portability; and low cost. The paper ends with some experimental results obtained with the proposed calibrator.},

This paper describes the development and evaluation of a six-axis force/moment sensor used under humanoid robot foot. The developed sensor is capable of measuring 400N horizontal force, 1000N vertical force, 20N·m moment about the horizontal axis and 10N·m moment about the vertical axis using rectangular cross-sectional beams. The structure of the sensor is newly modeled, and the sensing elements are simulated by using finite element method (FEM). Then the sensor is fabricated by attaching strain gages onto the beams. Finally, a characteristic test of the developed sensor is carried out, and the output from FEM analysis agrees with those from the characteristic test.}
