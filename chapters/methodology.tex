\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chapter:methodology}
In the thesis the main focus is to design a high linear, decoupled, modal structured multiaxial force sensors.
In the \nameref{chapter:literature_review} we describe theoretical background for the
task. 

The chapter specifies methodology of the design, therefore the chapter is divided into several sections. The first the \nameref{section:optical_modeling} section 
defines transition function for pressure sensor cell. The second section \nameref{section:calibration_pressure} describes the calibration method, used for pressure measurement cells.

The next \nameref{section:presure_cell_electic_circuit} section will provide the design used for measurement cells, the electric circuit and the used optical barrier shape.
