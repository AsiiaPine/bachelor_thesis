\section{Pressure Sensor Calibration}
\label{section:calibration_pressure}
Calibration process provide a linear transition function for barrier displacement and the output voltage of the measurement PT.
After the relation establishment, I used different materials for the barrier (acrylic resin, ABS, steel) for pressure sensor calibration with different pressure range.
